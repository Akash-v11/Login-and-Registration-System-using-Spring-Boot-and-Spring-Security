 Spring Login and Registration project:

ðŸ”¹ Empowering Secure Access with Spring Security! ðŸš€

I've developed a Login and Registration System using Spring Boot and Spring Security! ðŸŒŸ
Here are the highlights:
âœ… Role-based redirection for Admin and User dashboards.
âœ… Secure user authentication with encrypted passwords.
âœ… Entity management for user details with JPA and Hibernate.

Excited to explore more in Java frameworks and contribute to innovative solutions. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸ’¡
